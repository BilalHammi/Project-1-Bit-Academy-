# Project-1-Bit-Academy-

Description: 

With project-1 we used everything that we've learned in year one and made an password manager website. 
Where you can save your account of any platform. You can edit the password/username.
Delete the saved accounts, create an account on our website to save your accounts of other platforms.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

How to use it:

1. Log in or if you dont have an account just click on the "sign up button" to create your account.

2. if you have logged in go to the side-bar and add your account of your liking or add a note to reminder yourself of certain things.

3. If you have created an account and you have recently changed your password/username you can go to your account-overview. And edit your password/username.

That's what you can do with our password manager website!
